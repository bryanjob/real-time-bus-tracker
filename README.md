# MIT-Harvard Real-Time Bus Tracker ðŸšŒ


## Description

This project provides a real-time visualization of the buses traveling along MIT-Harvard.  Buses traveling northbound are represented by red bus markers, whereas buses traveling southbound are represented by blue bus markers.  The upper right corner of each bus marker contains an indicator that represents seat capacity.

- red = no seats available
- orange = few seats available
- green = many seats available
- grey = seat status unknown

The title of each map marker is contained in the tooltip and can be seen by mousing over any map marker.  The bus marker locations are updated every 15 seconds by making an API call to Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, [MBTA](https://www.mbta.com/developers/v3-api).

## How to Run

1. Fork a copy of this project to your [GitHub](https://github.com) repository
2. Clone a copy from your [GitHub](https://github.com) repository to your local machine
3. Create an [account](http://account.mapbox.com) at [Mapbox](http://www.mapbox.com) for a [Mapbox access token](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/glossary/access-token/)
4. In the JavaScript file, replace ['YOUR_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN'](./script/realTimeBusTracker.js) with your Mapbox access token
5. Open the index file in your web browser


## Roadmap of Future Improvements

- [x] Replace default Mapbox map markers with custom markers
- [x] Add bus seat occupancy status indicator to bus markers
